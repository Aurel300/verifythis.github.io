## Online Result and Exchange Event

**27th April 2020, 11:00 UTC?**
To participate follow the link and instruction at
**<https://>**

## Introduction

A final workshop  session for the challenge had been  planned at ETAPS
(along  with the  [VerifyThis  program  verification competition](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/verifythis.html)).
Since ETAPS has been postponed, we will meet and exchange online.

<!--
We have received several submissions that each contribute a solution to
different aspects of the challenge  using  different  abstractions,
different assumptions and different verification techniques.
-->

During this online meeting, the  different solutions will  be briefly
explained, and  we discuss the  approaches, how they can  benefit from
one another and how further verification success can be stipulated.


## Who can join the meeting? 

Everybody  who  is  interested   about  the  challenge,  the  proposed
solutions and VerifyThis is cordially to join the meeting!

## Meetings rules

Please respect the following simple meeting rules to have a productive meeting:
* dial in 5 minutes in advance
* mute when not speaking (avoid noise)
* turn off video to save bandwidth, turn on video when you want to speak
* use a headset if possible (avoid reverberation) 


This meeting is not meant as a replacement of the on-site event.  It
is meant as an informal event to exchange ideas, to give positive
impulses on further advances of approaches, or on how to combine
solutions. If the situation permits, the onsite event will take place
in autumn during ETAPS.
