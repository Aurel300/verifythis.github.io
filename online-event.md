## Online Result and Exchange Event

**27th April 2020, [11:00 UTC](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=VerifyThis&iso=20200427T12&p1=964&ah=3)**

[Information for participating are below.](#participating)

A final workshop  session for the challenge had been  planned at ETAPS
(along  with the  [VerifyThis  program  verification competition](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/verifythis.html)).
Since ETAPS has been postponed, we will meet and exchange online.
We have received several submissions that each contribute a solution to
different aspects of the challenge  using  different  abstractions,
different assumptions and different verification techniques.
During this online meeting, the  different solutions will  be briefly
explained, and  we discuss the  approaches, how they can  benefit from
one another and how further verification success can be stipulated.

### Agenda

**Agenda follows on April, 20th**

### Who can join the meeting? 

Everybody  who  is  interested   about  the  challenge, formal verification,  
the  proposed solutions and VerifyThis is cordially to join the meeting!

### How can I join the meeting?

We are currently evaluating web conferences and web cast technologies. 
We try to provide detail information how to join before the April, 20th. 
Please stay tuned, as you might need to register yourself for the web conference 
in our defence of spammers.
