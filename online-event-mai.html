<p>The <a href="/">VerifyThis Collaborative Large Scale Challenge</a>
    aims at proving that deductive program verification can produce
    relevant results for real systems with acceptable effort. We
    selected <a href="https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid">HAGRID</a>,
    a recently developed PGP-keyserver, for the challenge. Its
    development became necessary as the old keyserver had serious data
    protection and security issues.</p>

<p>In April 2020 four approaches to the verification challenge have
    been submitted to and presented during an online workshop, and in
    November 2020, a <a href="online-event-nov.html">follow-up online
    discussion</a> revealed interesting new ideas regarding
    specification and verifiation of interacting systems like
    Hagrid.</p>

<!--<p><em>We would like to continue and deepen this discussion in this online
    meeting, in particular thinking about the potentials of using
    automata-based specifications for the specification of interacting
    systems. How does automata specification tie in with
    contract-based specification? How with model checking?</em></p>
