<p>The <a href="/">VerifyThis Collaborative Large Scale Challenge</a>
    aims at proving that deductive program verification can produce
    relevant results for real systems with acceptable effort. We
    selected <a href="https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid">HAGRID</a>,
    a recently developed PGP-keyserver, for the challenge. Its
    development became necessary as the old keyserver had serious data
    protection and security issues.</p>

<p>In April 2020 four approaches to the verification challenge have
    been submitted to and presented during an online workshop, and in
    November 2020, a <a href="online-event-nov.html">follow-up online
    discussion</a> revealed interesting new ideas regarding
    specification and verifiation of interacting systems like
    Hagrid.</p>

<p><em>We would like to continue and deepen this discussion in this online
    meeting, in particular thinking about the potentials of using
    automata-based specifications for the specification of interacting
    systems. How does automata specification tie in with
    contract-based specification? How with model checking?</em></p>

<h3>Material</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/VerifyThisLTC-Nov2020.pdf">Slides from the meeting in November</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000119426">Informal Proceedings of the solutions</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Agenda</h3>

<ul>
    <li><b>Presentation of a automata-based specification for
        Hagrid</b> as a starting point for a discussion on the
        requirements and benefits of such a way of specification.<br>
        Interesting questions include:
        <ul>
            <li>What is the right formalism?
            <li>How does it relate to ghost code?
            <li>How does it relate to design-by-contract?
            <li>What is the specified entity? (a "component"?)
            <li>Can this bring model checking and deduction into one
                integrated verification approach?
            <li>Is this suited for lightweight and/or heavyweight
                specification?
            <li>...
        </ul>

    <li><b>Concrete plans from here on</b>
</ul>
