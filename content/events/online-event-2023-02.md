[Information for participating are below.](#participating)

**Backgrund:** The [VerifyThis Collaborative Large Scale Challenge](/)
aims at proving that deductive program verification can produce
relevant results for real systems with acceptable effort. We initially
looked [HAGRID](https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid) as a case
study, but have since moved on to considering [a simple Solidity
casino](/casino) as the running example.

**Agenda:** We are happy to invite you to join for the final round of presentations
on the Casino case study, one by [Franck Cassez (Macquarie University)](https://franck44.github.io/)
and one by [Alexander J. Summers (University of British Columbia)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/), and 
one by and [Marco Eilers (ETH Zurich)](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/people/personal/meilers-pers.html).

We aim to wrap up the discussion of the Casino case study and make
plans for follow-up work. See you soon!
