We also created a summary of the discussed Casino smart contract example:

== Agenda ==

In earlier meetings we have discussed what general specification
concepts exist, with particular focus on exploring automaton- and
contract-based techniques and their potential relationships.

For the upcoming meeting, we want to encourage you, the participants, to sketch a specification of the Casino in your favourite specification formalism.

Further information will be on the following webpage very soon:

If you have any question or remarks, feel free to get in touch.

Best regards,

    Alexander and Mattias for the organisers
