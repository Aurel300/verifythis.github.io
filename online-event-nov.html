<h1>Online Discussion</h1>
<p><strong>27th November 2020,
    <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=VerifyThis&amp;iso=2020-11-27T10:00:00">10:00 UTC</a></strong></p>

<p>The <a href="/">VerifyThis Collaborative Large Scale Challenge</a>
  aims at proving that deductive program verification can produce
  relevant results for real systems with acceptable effort. We
  selected <a href="https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid">HAGRID</a>,
  a recently developed PGP-keyserver, for the challenge. Its
  development became necessary as the old keyserver had serious data
  protection and security issues.</p>

<p>In April four approaches to the verification challenge have been
    submitted to and presented during an online workshop.</p>

<p> A Dagstuhl seminar on contract-based specification languages was
originally planned for the last week in November 2020, but had to be
cancelled.</p>

<p>We would like to seize the opportunity to use the challenge system
and the available solutions to stipulate a discussion on the features
that an ideal specification language would possess for this
purpose. This online discussion will start a discussion involving
people together who are interested in the design of contract languages
and the participants of systems like the challenge who want to make
use of contract languages in their specifications.</p>

<h4>Summary of discussion on contract specification languages (November 27, 2020)</h4>
<em>Summarised by Marieke Huisman, Raul Monti, Mattias Ulbrich and Alexander Weigl</em>

<p>
    Before the discussion started, a round-up on Hagrid, the verifying
    keyserver, was given in a short talk. On an abstract level, Hagrid is
    an interactive system and a typical representative of service-oriented
    software. Hagrid provides five endpoints, which can be called in an
    arbitrary and parallel manner, to manipulate the internal database of
    known public keys.
</p>
<p>
    The discussion first focused on finding the right level of abstraction
    in specifications. For some applications (including the VerifyThis
    long term challenge) writing an abstract (i.e., behavioural/executable)
    model is the most natural way to capture the desired
    properties/behaviour, rather than doing this directly in terms of
    declarative specifications like contracts. But then of course, the
    question is: what is the connection between this model and the
    contracts. Ideally, we would like to have some way to link those:
    generate contracts from a model, or generate a model from the
    contracts. For Hagrid, the connection between the model and the
    contracts is relatively clear, but this is not always the case. Also,
    when generating models or contracts from each other, the big challenge
    is to come up with the right level of abstraction.
</p>
<p>

    What is the right level of specification (abstract model or contracts)
    also depends on what you want to use the specifications for (and in
    addition, it can also depend on who actually writes the
    specification). A reason to use contracts could be that you want the
    developers to look at the specifications, and they are looking at the
    code. Moreover, it is important to remember that models are not
    necessarily the same as the properties you are interested in - but of
    course, there is a connection.
</p>
<p>
    There was a common agreement that not every class of properties can be
    expressed (nicely) at contract level, but contracts come into play
    when we want to say things method-modularly at implementation
    level, because they make it possible to use divide-and-conquer
    techniques for reasoning. Some things are complex at the
    implementation level (think about string handling for example), while
    they can be nicely explained at an abstract level. Other examples are
    protocols, or event histories. These can be encoded at the level of
    contracts, but as the specification notions then are not first-class,
    it can make reasoning a bit cumbersome, and it can blur the meaning of
    the specification (but it is good to have the possibility to encode
    these things, to experiment with different verification approaches).
</p>
<p>
    Finally, it was stressed that models also can be considered as a
    contract e.g. as a form of assume-guarantee reasoning), so maybe we
    should simply embrace the notion of abstract model as part of our
    contract specification languages. We already have class invariants,
    why not also finite state machine, regular expressions or whatever. If
    we want to do this, we might want to consider the SVComp format to
    specify automata. This might also give us a different view on
    contracts: a contract should not just express the relation between the
    pre-state and post-state of a method, but it should capture all the
    effects a method has between its call and return point. A contract
    then constrains what a method is allowed to do by the outside world,
    and it should declare in what sequences certain things are going to
    happen. Of course, if we take this view, we have to distinguish
    between the effects of a method itself, and the effects that are
    created by other actors. If we take this view, then we should also
    define a suitable counterpart for framing conditions of these “effect
    contracts”. The connection between a model state machine and ghost
    code maintaining an internal state of an object have been
    discussed. One way to see this is that a state machine is a
    specification of how ghost state evolves that could also be
    implemented using ghost code. Nevertheless some find it clear to
    separate the model with abstract behavior from the code itself. Then
    the code should be proven to be a refinement of the model behavior.
</p>
<p>

    There exists different work in this direction. The KeY team once
    worked on the possibility to extract contracts from state charts.
    Simon Bliudze is working on a technique to annotate Java classes with
    states and transitions, where some methods describe transitions, and
    other methods serve as guards. Marieke Huisman and Wytse Oortwijn
    worked on adding the notion of models to the annotation language of
    VerCors (based on permission-based separation logic). The logic allows
    one to prove that the program behaves according to the model, i.e. the
    program refines the model. External tools (currently mCRL2) are used
    to verify behavioural properties about the model, and from this we can
    conclude that the program also satisfies these properties.

</p>
<p>

    The discussion then continued on the relation between inheritance and
    contracts. How does inheritance match with abstract models? For this
    you would need some form of behavioural subtyping. Of course, a
    challenge is that programming languages do not guarantee behavioural
    subtyping, thus this requires discipline from the programmer. There is
    a discussion whether we could find ways to automatically characterise
    when inheritance coincides with refinement/behavioural subtyping. The
    theory of behavioural subtyping is wellknown, but it requires careful
    checks from the developer.
</p>
<p>

    Last, tool support for contract languages was discussed. Tools like
    Dafny are nice to use, but it can be annoying that you never get the
    symbolic state if verification fails, which can make it hard to
    understand why verification fails.
</p>
<p>

    A few approaches to address this problem are discussed. Mattias, from
    the KeY team is working on an interactive Dafny verification
    environment (DIVE), which gives more feedback when verification fails.
    With Why3, there is extensive support for the manipulation of a
    non-provable goal. SPARK tries to provide user feedback, based on
    relatively simple checks. For example, if a variable is used in the
    method, but not mentioned in the pre- and postconditions. The StaDy
    plugin of Frama-C uses dynamic verification to analyse the reason that
    static verification fails, and it can give feedback if that was
    because of missing pre- and postconditions, implementation errors, or
    prover incompleteness.
