<h1>Online Discussion</h1>
<p><strong>27th November 2020,
    <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=VerifyThis&amp;iso=2020-11-27T10:00:00">11:00 CET</a></strong></p>

<p>The <a href="/">VerifyThis Collaborative Large Scale Challenge</a>
  aims at proving that deductive program verification can produce
  relevant results for real systems with acceptable effort. We
  selected <a href="https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid">HAGRID</a>,
  a recently developed PGP-keyserver, for the challenge. Its
  development became necessary as the old keyserver had serious data
  protection and security issues.</p>

<p>In April four approaches to the verification challenge have been
    submitted to and presented during an online workshop.</p>

<p> A Dagstuhl seminar on contract-based specification languages was
originally planned for the last week in November 2020, but had to be
cancelled.</p>

<p>We would like to seize the opportunity to use the challenge system
and the available solutions to stipulate a discussion on the features
that an ideal specification language would possess for this
purpose. This online discussion will start a discussion involving
people together who are interested in the design of contract languages
and the participants of systems like the challenge who want to make
use of contract languages in their specifications.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Introduction to Hagrid</b>
        <ol>
            <li>Overview of the Long Term Challenge
            <li>What is HAGRID?
            <li>Brief summary of the solutions submitted thus far
        </ol>

    <li><b>Hagrid as a Specification Challenge</b><br> Discussion on
        the ideal specification language for service-based software
        sytems using HAGRID as showcase.  Discussion will be driven by
        a number of guiding questions:
        <ul>
            <li>What clauses does an ideal contract language have?
            <li><em>If you want to add an interesting question, feel
            free to contact us!</em>
        </ul>
        
    <li><b>Concrete plans from here on</b>
</ul>
