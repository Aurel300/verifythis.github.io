[Information for participating are below.](#participating)

The [VerifyThis Collaborative Large Scale Challenge](/) aims at proving
that deductive program verification can produce relevant results for
real systems with acceptable effort. We selected
[HAGRID](https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid), a recently
developed PGP-keyserver, for the challenge. Its development became
necessary as the old keyserver had serious data protection and security
issues.

**Agenda:** 

In earlier meetings we have discussed what general specification
concepts exist, with particular focus on exploring automaton- and
contract-based techniques and their potential relationships.

For the upcoming meeting, we want to encourage you, the participants,
to sketch a specification of the [Casino Example](/casino) in your
favorite specification formalism.
