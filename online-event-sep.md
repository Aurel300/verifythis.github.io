[Information for participating are below.](#participating)

The [VerifyThis Collaborative Large Scale Challenge](/) aims at proving
that deductive program verification can produce relevant results for
real systems with acceptable effort. We selected
[HAGRID](https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid), a recently
developed PGP-keyserver, for the challenge. Its development became
necessary as the old keyserver had serious data protection and security
issues.

**Agenda:** We will continue and deepen this discussion by means of a
concrete example to be specified in this meeting. By discussing how
automata-related and contract-related specification artifacts could be
formulated, we plan to identify particular benefits from the viewpoints.
Moreover, it will allow us to constructively think about ideas how such
specifications can be integrated.

In April 2020 four approaches to the verification challenge have been
submitted to and presented during an online workshop, and in November
2020, a [follow-up online discussion](online-event-nov/) revealed
interesting new ideas regarding specification and verifiation of
interacting systems like Hagrid.

*We will continue and deepen this discussion by means of a concrete
